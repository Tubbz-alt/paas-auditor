## Overview

A Golang application that scrapes Cloud Controller's `/v2/events` endpoint for Audit Events and stores them in a Postgres database.

**To understand how to run this and solve issues, see the [RUNBOOK](RUNBOOK.md).**

## Installation

You will need:

* `Go v1.13+`

To build the application run the default make target:

```
make
```

You should then get a binary in `bin/paas-auditor`.

## Configuration

`paas-auditor` takes the following environment variables:

| Variable name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
